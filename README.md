Install guide
-------------

It's pretty simple, but if you aren't used to cmake, it might be new for you.

Use `git clone https://github.com/Zenol/ClanPgsql.git` to clone the repository.
Then, create a build directory, for example `mkdir build; cd build`.
You can now run cmake and create the build tree with `cmake ~/your_repository_clone` (in the example, it's `cmake ..`).

Once your build tree was generated by cmake, type `make` and `make install`.
